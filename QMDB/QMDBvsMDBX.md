### **2. Performance**

#### **QMDB Performance**
- **Throughput**:
  - Achieves up to **6× more updates per second** than RocksDB (601,000 updates/sec on AWS c7gd.metal).
  - Reaches **2.28 million updates/sec** on enterprise hardware (i8g.metal-24xl).
- **Scalability**:
  - Validated with up to 15 billion entries.
  - Theoretical capacity: 280 billion entries with hybrid indexing.

#### **MDBX Performance**
- **Throughput**:
  - Optimized for transactional workloads; benchmarked at high transaction rates.
  - Specific numbers depend on the configuration, with some community benchmarks achieving **100,000–500,000 updates/sec** for transactional systems.
- **Scalability**:
  - Performance may degrade for extremely large datasets due to reliance on copy-on-write mechanisms and file growth.

#### **Head-to-Head Comparison**
| Metric                  | QMDB                             | MDBX                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Updates per Second**  | 601,000–2.28 million             | 100,000–500,000                                 |
| **Scalability**         | Up to 280 billion entries        | Limited by file size and copy-on-write overhead |
| **Write Amplification** | Low (append-only design)         | Moderate (copy-on-write increases overhead)     |
| **Read Efficiency**     | Single SSD read per state lookup | Efficient for transactional reads               |
